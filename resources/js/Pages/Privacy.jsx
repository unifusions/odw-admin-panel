                            To deliver a seamless and secure experience, the ODW App requires access to certain device features, which are used solely to support core functionalities:

                            Camera Access: The App may request access to your device’s camera for purposes such as capturing dental images, scanning documents (e.g., treatment plans, prescriptions, insurance cards), or enabling teledentistry consultations. Images captured are processed and stored securely in accordance with HIPAA and applicable privacy regulations.

                            Location Access: With your explicit consent, the App may access your precise or approximate location via GPS, Wi-Fi, or cellular data to assist in locating nearby ODW-Powered Clinics, customizing region-specific content, or verifying clinic appointments. You may disable location services at any time in your device settings; however, certain features may become limited or unavailable.

                            Storage Access: The App may require permission to read and write to your device’s local storage to allow secure upload, download, and temporary caching of documents, X-rays, and related health information. Stored data is encrypted and never shared or accessed for purposes beyond the intended medical or operational use.

                            ODW strictly limits the use of these permissions to the functionalities described above and does not access or collect media, files, or location data outside of user-initiated actions. All permissions are governed by explicit consent and can be managed or revoked through your device’s privacy settings at any time.
